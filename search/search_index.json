By doing so, it supports better consistency in other documents that describe the software systems used by these users.  You can read this document both so that you may benefit from and also that you can contribute to, OpenDI standards.</p> <p>This document assumes you're familiar with OpenDI Intro Material, which sets the stage for the material here.</p>"},{"location":"#why-start-with-user-roles","title":"Why start with user roles?","text":"<p>By situating all standards within software systems that are used in well-defined ways by people in the roles described here, we are able to create better standards and software systems because they serve user's needs that have been studied for many years.  In addition, by standardizing around user roles, this leads to better consistency and interoperability in systems that we create.</p> <p>This document therefore serves as a foundation for the rest of the OpenDI Reference Architecture. In keeping with best practices in user-centered design \u2014 it's important to understand how a DI system is to be used.</p> <p>As a foundation for that, in turn, it's important to start with who will be using the DI system, and why.  </p> <p>The purpose of this living document is therefore to capture user stories for the DI reference architecture, which is summarized in Figure 2 in OpenDI Intro Material. User stories, per Agile best practice are not requirements, but are plain-language descriptions of how software \"will provide value to users\".  They provide a framework into which more detailed, \"functional\", requirements are added later.  Over many years of software development, we've learned that, if our goal is to build systems that are \"fit for purpose\", explaining things in this way is the easiest for humans to understand and to ensure we're building the right solutions.</p>"},{"location":"#objective","title":"Objective","text":"<p>With the above information as context, then, the objective of this document is twofold:</p> <ol> <li>Contributors: To align contributors to the OpenDI Reference Architecture so we are all on the same page as to what software users need; and</li> <li>Consumers: To serve as the authoritative point of reference for engineering teams that are working on the OpenDI Reference Architecture directly or implementing OpenDI features in an OpenDI-compliant artifact. </li> </ol> <p>By way of illustration for #2, a software vendor might be interested in creating just one part of this architecture - perhaps the connection to data in the bottom layer of Figure 2 of  OpenDI Intro Material.  Such a vendor can read this document to ensure that the system they build can be integrated with systems from other vendors that help a user to create a decision model, and to use a decision simulation system. This means that the data connection vendor can deliver its products much faster to market, because it doesn't have to deliver the entire \"stack\" of DI modules.</p> <p>There are also open source teams that are developing modules that are compliant with the OpenDI architecture.  This means that if you are developing a proprietary module, then by following this standard you'll be able to leverage those open source systems, thereby de-risking and de-costing your product.  </p> <p>Note that the roles and associated use cases in this document are limited to those associated with the use of DI software systems. Out of scope for this document are roles and use cases that don't involve the use of DI software. For example, The Decision Intelligence Handbook describes a process for creating a decision framing document, which is the responsibility of a Decision Team Leader role. This role is not explicitly called out in this document, because it does not interact with DI software in ways that aren't covered by other roles. Nor is the creation of the Framing Document a user story described here, for the same reason.</p>"},{"location":"#who-reads-this-document","title":"Who reads this document?","text":"<p>Generally speaking, we expect this document to be used by software architects and/or technical leads who have decided to build software modules that follow the OpenDI standard.
