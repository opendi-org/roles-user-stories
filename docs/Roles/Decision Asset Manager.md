# Decision Asset Manager

## Who is a Decision Asset Manager?

As a Decision Asset Manager, I am responsible for curating a library of decision assets in a form usable by other roles. My work involves identifying reusable assets that arise during other parts of the DI workflow, or as standalone efforts outside that scope.

The assets I create are accessed by [Decision Model Builders](./Decision%20Model%20Builder.md), [DI Analysts](./DI%20Analyst.md), and [Decision Simulation Builders](./Decision%20Simulation%20Builder.md). They are typically used by [Decision Model Builders](./Decision%20Model%20Builder.md), [DI analysts](./DI%20Analyst.md), [Decision Simulation Builders](./Decision%20Simulation%20Builder.md), [Decision Monitor Builders](./Decision%20Monitor%20Builder.md), and [Decision Monitors](./Decision%20Monitor.md).

The assets that I work with are used both in the time frame *before* a decision is made, as well as *after* the decision is made. 

## User Stories

1. As a Decision Asset Manager, I want to **curate the asset library**, so that I may ensure that assets are of high quality, are up-to-date, and are otherwise fit for purpose. 
2. As a Decision Asset Manager, I want to **add new assets** to the asset library, so that other roles have more tools at their disposal.
3. As a Decision Asset Manager, I want to **update existing assets** so that the asset library maintains relevance and quality.
4. As a Decision Asset Manager, I want to **remove existing assets** so that assets that are low quality, outdated, or otherwise unfit for purpose do not clutter the asset library.
5. As a Decision Asset Manager, I want to **track, document, and verify the provenance** of assets, so that I can further ensure the accuracy, legitimacy, and quality of the assets in the library.
6. As a Decision Asset Manager, I want to **characterize computational and related resources** in asset metadata, so that I can ensure assets are able to facilitate simulation.
7. As a Decision Asset Manager, I want to **maintain subject-matter awareness** of what is available in the asset library, so that I can more easily curate the library and better advise other roles in asset selection.
8. As a Decision Asset Manager, I want to **communicate the availability of assets** in the asset library, so that other roles can easily access and utilize them.
9. As a Decision Asset Manager, I want to **communicate and enforce metadata compliance** of assets in the library, so that it is easier for everyone to navigate and better utilize the asset library.
10. As a Decision Asset Manager, I want to **package multiple assets into groups**, so that frequently-combined assets are easier to discover and utilize.
11. As a Decision Asset Manager, I want to **access and incorporate assets from other libraries** maintained by other individuals or organizations, so that I can enrich the asset library that I maintain.
