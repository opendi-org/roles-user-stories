# OpenDI System Administrator

## Who is an OpenDI System Administrator?

I am an IT professional, devops engineer, or service provider who is responsible for setting up and configuring OpenDI compliant software and/or services. I may be responsible for a private network or a public or hybrid cloud architecture. I need not have any expertise or knowledge of DI, but I will generally understand network and systems administration and have super user privileges on the infrastructure I operate. I will not work directly with other roles, but will act to support users in those other roles. 

I support the other roles in both the time frame *before* a decision is made, as well for decision monitoring *after* the decision is made. 

## User Stories

1. As an OpenDI System Administrator, I want to **install OpenDI-compliant software** on systems I manage, so that my users can use that software in their business operations.
2. As an OpenDI System Administrator, I want to **create user accounts**, so that users in other roles then me can access OpenDI-compliant systems.
3. As an OpenDI System Administrator, I want to **manage the privileges** of user accounts, so that I can control which users have access to which services.
4. As an OpenDI System Administrator, I want to **create organizations** with collections of users with related access needs, so that users will have the proper level of granularity in access and sharing of assets, models, _etc_.
5. As an OpenDI System Administrator, I want to **integrate OpenDI-compliant software** from other vendors or other OpenDI-compliant components from the same vendor, so that my users are able to access a wide variety of capabilities across a diverse ecosystem.  
   "Integrate" means that OpenDI-compliant software components are able to interoperate within the local user base. This could mean limiting access to software instances that are managed, or providing access to OpenDI-compliant software managed by an OpenDI system administrator in another organization.
6. As an OpenDI System Administrator, I want to **backup and restore configurations and assets**, so that I can support rapid recoveries from system outages, bugs, or user errors.  
   This may require scaling the infrastructure, and redeploying.
7. As an OpenDI System Administrator, I want to **support Service Level Agreements**, so that I can ensure SLA compliance.  
   Certain user bases will require service level agreements (e.g., Severity 2 bugs are fixed in 24 hours; systems are up 99.9% of the time, etc). I am responsible for all activities that ensure SLA compliance.
8. As an OpenDI System Administrator, I want to **monitor and ensure the security** of my systems, so that I can support both SLAs as well as safeguard PII and proprietary data, models, and information.
9. As an OpenDI System Administrator, I want to **monitor and scale the infrastructure** up and down as needed, so that I meet the needs of my users and manage costs of operating the infrastructure.
10. As an OpenDI System Administrator, I want to **support other roles as they integrate with real-time data sources and other assets** so that computational and network resources are available and properly configured based on which roles need them and when.
