# DI Analyst

## Who is a DI Analyst?

I am a technical specialist who collaborates with stakeholders, who include but are not limited to, [Decision Makers](./Decision%20Maker.md). Together we produce customer-facing artifacts like decision framing documents that enable [Decision Model Builder](./Decision%20Model%20Builder.md)s to build the Causal Decision Model, which is the computerized representation of the decision that supports the [Decision Maker](./Decision%20Maker.md) "under the hood".

Generally speaking, the decision assets I create are passed to the [Decision Model Builder](./Decision%20Model%20Builder.md) for refinement. In this sense, I am the "bridge" between non-DI experts and the team tasked with creating DI software solutions.

I work in the time frame *before* a decision is made, to help choose actions or combinations of actions.

## User Stories

1. As a DI Analyst, I want to **form a team of stakeholders**, so that we can collaboratively produce stakeholder-facing artifacts.  
   These stakeholders will likely contribute to building a model, and should have the right authorization to access and/or modify it.
2. As a DI Analyst, I want to work with stakeholders to **elicit the decision objective statement** and to **write the decision framing document**, so that I can ensure stakeholder alignment around the high-level purpose of their decision.
3. As a DI Analyst, I want to work with stakeholders to **create a causal decision diagram (CDD)** in software, so that I can ensure stakeholder alignment regarding the Levers, Outcomes, and other decision elements involved in their decision.
4. As a DI Analyst, I want to **refine the CDD** outside of stakeholder meetings, so that I can leverage my unique expertise with decision modeling to sort through the various input and discussion gathered during group elicitation.
5. As a DI Analyst, I want to **support the [Decision Model Builder](./Decision%20Model%20Builder.md)** to create a CDM based on the CDD, so that stakeholders can eventually model scenarios or run simulations to better determine an optimal set of actions to take.
6. As a DI Analyst, I want to provide an initial assessment of appropriate **model fidelity**, so that stakeholders can align around a common level of abstraction and complexity.
7. As a DI Analyst, I want to **document decision assets** that are identified during decision analysis, so that the decision team and stakeholders can refer to these artifacts later.
8. As a DI Analyst, I want the option to begin from a clean slate and **build a causal decision model from scratch**, so that I may think creatively and outside the bounds of existing models. This means I need to be able to create, update, or delete actions, outcomes, intermediates, and dependencies.
9. As a DI Analyst, I want the option to be able to search a **library of decision foundation models** so that I may find one that may act as a starting point, inspiration, or to provide CDD elements or CDM components that can be reused.
10. As a DI Analyst, I want to be able to **use a Large Language Model**, so that I may seek advice on decision elements I may have forgotten, including externals and unintended consequences.
