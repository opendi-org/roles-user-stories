# Decision Quality Assurance Manager

## Who is a Decision Quality Assurance Manager?

I am a person who provides oversight at every stage of the DI process. With every process, I have checklists and criteria that I apply to ensure that models and simulations are authored, run, and monitored in such a way that they are fit for purpose. This includes &mdash; but is not limited to &mdash; ensuring that these assets are free from defects.

I generally don't interact directly with CDMs, CDDs, or simulations, but keep track of processes and workflows that include them and examine KPIs of systems and assets. I do my work with both processes and artifacts.  It is my job to keep up with the latest best practices in decision intelligence processes and deliverables, and to ensure that these best practices are reflected within my organization.

Most of my work does not include interacting with software systems, but rather with the other roles. It is, for instance, my job to create *Quality Assurance processes and standards*, which may consist of assets like checklists, defect measurement methods, and/or documenting review processes.  It is also my job to execute or supervise the execution of the Quality Assurance processes. But these responsibilities aren't listed in the user stories below, because the OpenDI compliant software doesn't support them.

## User Stories
Note that, as described above, much of my work does not involve interacting with software, but with people.  My software-related user stories are therefore limited. They are as follows:

1. As a Decision Quality Assurance Manager, I want to **create, integrate, deploy, manage, and maintain any automated test software** for assets created by the other roles, e.g. CDDs, CDMs, and simulations, so that I can ensure these assets are fit for purpose and free from defects.
2. As a Decision Quality Assurance Manager, I want to **create reports and automated alerts regarding the status of various DI processes and activities**, including defects, test plans, and defect repair tasks, so that I can facilitate fast and high quality responses to issues with these processes and activities.
